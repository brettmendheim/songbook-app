[Verse 1]

 

Bm       A          E          A  Bm         A      E

I told Althea I was feeling lost, lacking in some direction.

Bm          A       E      A         Bm       A         E

Althea told me upon scrutiny that my back might need protection.

 

  A                C#m           D          A

I told Althea that treachery was tearing me limb from limb.

  C#m                 E              Bm          A         E

Althea told me better cool down boy, settle back, easy Jim.

[Verse 2]

 

Bm         A          E         A

You may be Saturday's child, all alone,

Bm          A          E

Moving with a tinge of grace.

Bm          A         E           A

You may be a clown in the burying ground,

Bm             A       E

Or just another pretty face.

 

A                       C#m     D                           A

You may be the fate of Ophelia, sleeping and perchance to dream.

C#m                    E             Bm           A       E

Honest to the point of recklessness, self-centered in the extreme.

[Verse 3]

 

Bm           A            E        A

Ain't nobody messing with you, but you,

Bm               A            E

Your friends are getting most concerned.

Bm             A           E         A     Bm       A         E

Loose with the truth, baby it's your fire, but baby don't get burned.

 

A                  C#m                D                    A

When the smoke has cleared, she said, that's what she said to me.

C#m                 E             Bm          A         E

Gonna want a bed to lay your head and a little sympathy.

[Bridge]

 

D                    G            E

There are things you can replace, and others you cannot.

D                    G

The time has come to weigh those things.

E                          Bm            A                E

This space is getting hot, you know this space is getting hot.

[Verse 4]

 

Bm       A          E      A    Bm        A              E

I told Althea I'm a roving son, and I was born to be a bachelor.

Bm         A          E            Bm    A              E

Althea told me, okay, that's fine, so now I'm trying to catch her.

 

A                         C#m

Can't talk to you without talking to me,

      D                      A

We're guilty of the same old thing.

C#m                      E

Been thinking a lot about less and less

Bm            A            E

And forgetting the love we bring.
